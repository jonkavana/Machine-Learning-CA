# Machine Learning & Statitics Overview 

In this file, we will aim to provide an overview of the Assessment that has been laid out in the "Assessment" that has been added into this folder. 

### Marking Scheme

#### Task 1
Create a GITHUB repository
- Within this repository, there should be two Jupyter notebooks(indicated by their file extension .ipynb)
ReadME.MD
- Explaining why the repository exists, what is in it, and how to run the notebooks
Requirements.txt
- enables someone to quickly run your notebooks with minimal configuration. You should also include any other required files such as data files and image files

#### Task 2
Within this task, we need to be able to focus our attention on the SciKit Package. 
There needs to be consideration in relation to:
- Clear and concise overview of the scikit-learn python library
- Demonstration for three seperate algorithms in this library. Dealers choice
- Plots and visualisations to enhance the notebook for viewers.

#### Task 3
Within this task, we need to be able to focus our attention on the SciKit Package. 
There needs to be consideration in relation to:
- Clear and concise overview of the scipy.stats python library
- Example hypothesis test using ANOVA
- Need to be able to conduct secondary research on a data set that is appropriate
- Assumptions need to be in place with ANOVA, and they need to be considered prior to trialling anything
- Perform and display the results of ANOVA using SciPy.Stats Library
- Plots and visualisations to enhance the notebook for viewers.

### Additional Information for consideration

#### Research
- Evidence of research performed on topic; submission based on referenced literature, particularly academic literature; evidence of understanding the documentation for any software or libraries used.

#### Development
- Environment can be set up as described; code works without tweaking and as described; code is efficient, clean, and clear; evidence of consideration of standards and conventions appropriate to code of this kind.

#### Consistency
- Evidence of planning and project management; pragmatic attitude to work as evidenced by well-considered commit history; commits are of a reasonable size; consideration of how commit history will be perceived by others.

#### Documentation
- Clear documentation of how to create an environment in which any code will run, how to prepare the code for running, how to run the code including setting any options or flags, and what to expectupon running the code. Concise descriptions of code in comments and README.
