### Machine Learning & Statistics Project

### Description
The purpose of this project is to exemplify the properties of both the SciPY & SciKit -Learn libraries which can be leveraged in the Python Programming Language. 
There is a required set of points that need to be displayed in these notebooks, such as the overall structure of the libraries and how they are to be called in the commmand line. 
The comparisions and contrasts between each library will be displayed in each set of notebooks, but the overall goal is the same. Being able to display  specific components of each module, explain how they work and lastly, be able to display to the reader what each component achieves. 

### Installation

need to have:
- anaconda
- cmder
- VSCode
- jupyter lab
- scipy
- sckitlearn

### Instructions

1. SciPy Notebook

In order to effectively undertake this notebook, you need to be able to run it from the start, and from at no other point in the notebook. this is due to the fact that the libraries as well as subsequnt sub-packages need to be run in sequential order. 

2. SciKit Learn Notebook

In order to effectively undertake this notebook, you need to be able to run it from the start, and from at no other point in the notebook. this is due to the fact that the libraries as well as subsequnt sub-packages need to be run in sequential order.
