### Title 

Machine Learning & Statistics Module: Scipy & SckiKit Learn Project 2021

### Description
The purpose of this project is to exemplify the properties of both the SciPy & SciKit-Learn libraries which can be leveraged in the Python Programming Language. 
There is a required set of points that need to be displayed in these notebooks, such as the overall structure of the libraries and how they are to be called in the command line. 
The comparisons and contrasts between each library will be displayed in each set of notebooks, but the overall goal is the same. Being able to display  specific components of each module, explain how they work and lastly, be able to display to the reader what each component achieves.

In order to run these notebooks, an installataion guideline has been detailed as well as line by line instructions per notebook. If there are any additional technical requirements that are met whilst running these notebooks, a comprehensive list of support has also been detailed.

### Installation

need to have:
- anaconda
- cmder
- VSCode
- jupyter lab
- scipy
- sckitlearn

### Instructions
The running order for reading these notebooks is not important, in that there is no direct linkage or dependency between. They have been created independently whilst being conscious of their similarities.
To run both of these notebooks, they can be run in the same manner. If you are viewing this document on github, you can clone down the repository as it has been made publicly available. 
Open your terminal on where you would like to run the notebooks. Using gitclone commmand followed by the specifi URL for this repository, press enter to run the code. 
Once the repository has been downloaded you can view both of the notebooks using Jupyter. Simply entering Jupyter lab once you are this repository will allow the user to read from a browser. Chrome & FIrefox have been used throughout the development of these notebooks to ensure they read/run correctly. 

1. SciPy Notebook: scipy-stats.ipynb

To comprehensively read this notebook, there has been due consideration for the layout in terms of readability. An overview of the SciPy package has been provided, as well as additional material in terms of the underlying support namely NumPy & MatPlotLib. Given the enormity of the SciPy library, a brief note and link on what it can aid in has been provided. These are all primarily written in markdown format, so there should be no issue in running the cells.

So that the notebook will function, we need to import the packages detailed in the library’s to be imported section. This will allow each of the subsequent sections to function. Given the amount of effort on Jupyter Lab to run this block of code, it may take a moment or two to complete. This will be known when a number has replaced the asterisk which indicates a code is being run.

Should you  choose to see a complete breakdown of the information stored in the SciPy Package, simply remove the hashtag character from the code to see a complete listing. 
The sections to follow are all laid in the structure of the official site for the SciPy Library, whilst being conscious of the requirements that are laid out in the Assessment form.
Descriptive statistics have been laid out at the front to provide ease of readability and to ease the reader into the notebook. From that point, we move into the Probability distribution setting of the library, ensuring that there is an example and visual representative where possible of each distribution type. 

Next Steps & future Development: 
Whilst I made the decision to focus on the area of Statistics, i thnk that in any future developments it owuld be beneficial to look in the areas of optimisation because of the overlap into statistics. Otherwise, i think the next area to become more familiar with is the area of linear algebra because it develops on the numpy package which i have a good working knowledge on at this stage. 

2. SciKit Learn Notebook: scikit-Learn.ipynb

Next Steps & future Development: 
Whilst I made the decision early on to focus on the area of Regression, i am conscious of the fact that there are so many other areas that could have been analysed. I think that in future endevours i would like to research and devlop on other areas of machine learning suhc as Classification.
