### Title 

Machine Learning & Statistics Module: Scipy & SckiKit Learn Project 2021

### Description
The purpose of this project is to exemplify the properties of both the SciPy & SciKit-Learn libraries which can be leveraged in the Python Programming Language. 
There is a required set of points that need to be displayed in these notebooks, such as the overall structure of the libraries and how they are to be called in the command line. 
The comparisons and contrasts between each library will be displayed in each set of notebooks, but the overall goal is the same. Being able to display  specific components of each module, explain how they work and lastly, be able to display to the reader what each component achieves.

### Installation

need to have:
- anaconda
- cmder
- VSCode
- jupyter lab
- scipy
- sckitlearn

### Instructions
The running order for reading these notebooks is not important, in that there is no direct linkage or dependency between. They have been created independently whilst being conscious of their similarities.

1. SciPy Notebook

To comprehensively read this notebook, there has been due consideration for the layout in terms of readability. An overview of the SciPy package has been provided, as well as additional material in terms of the underlying support namely NumPy & MatPlotLib. Given the enormity of the SciPy library, a brief note and link on what it can aid in has been provided. These are all primarily written in markdown format, so there should be no issue in running the cells.

So that the notebook will function, we need to import the packages detailed in the library’s to be imported section. This will allow each of the subsequent sections to function. Given the amount of effort on Jupyter Lab to run this block of code, it may take a moment or two to complete. This will be known when a number has replaced the asterisk which indicates a code is being run.

Should you  choose to see a complete breakdown of the information stored in the SciPy Package, simply remove the hashtag character from the code to see a complete listing. 
The sections to follow are all laid in the structure of the official site for the SciPy Library, whilst being conscious of the requirements that are laid out in the Assessment form.
Descriptive statistics have been laid out at the front to provide ease of readability and to ease the reader into the notebook. From that point, we move into the Probability distribution setting of the library, ensuring that there is an example and visual representative where possible of each distribution type.
